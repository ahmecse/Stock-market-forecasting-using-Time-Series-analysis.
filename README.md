# Stock-market-forecasting-using-Time-Series-analysis.
In this study, we examine data from various industries, including banking and information technology, to glean insights from the data. Using the concepts of Time Series, we
comprehensively obtain insights and analyse different stocks in a large amount of data. We then try to forecast our predictions that could help analyse an investment’s risks and benefits. To
comprehend the behaviour of the stock market, we employ specific measures and graphs from the financial world. We model stock market data sets using this information. Then we look at
each stock’s distinct behaviour, individually and across sectors. Due to the complex nature and the abstractness involved in Stock Market, it is often necessary to forego a detailed analysis before
investments to make informed choices.
